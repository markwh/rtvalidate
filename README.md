# rtvalidate

Functions for validating SWOT river products (river tiles). Unlike the [rivertile](https://github.com/markwh/rivertile) package, **rtvalidate** is not intended for wide usage and is not as meticulously designed and tested. Many funcitons herein were formerly part of the **rivertile** package, but were determined not to be sufficiently useful for the majority of use cases.
